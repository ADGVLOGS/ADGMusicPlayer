# Web - ADGMusicPlayer

#### Motivation
I wanted to experiment by makeing a streaming service which can stream music and what could be a better way than putting my SoundCloud likes on the app.

#### Legal Issues
<p>I am assuming SoundCloud is open source with their music as there are many individual artists and freelance artists on that platform including myself who made few songs back in the day playing with Logic Pro X. 
but if there is any issues with me hosting the songs on my platform always feel free to send me an email to adgrules@hotmail.com and we can calmly sort it out or i can remove the material instantly</p>

#### Reusablity
<p>Sure you can reuse this project as your own and add your own music just fire up your terminal and</p>

````
git clone https://github.com/ADGVLOGS/ADGMusicPlayer
````

#### How to make this code work?

* Basically you need to make a .json file and edit index.html to make it your own i did 99% of the work for you.
* to generate .json fire up solution.ipynb and run the blocks of code to download your likes from SoundCloud and generate the .json file.
* once done with that you just copy and paste it into the JavaScript code and add the .json to the JavaScript to fill the libary.

#### hope you have fun with the project :-)
